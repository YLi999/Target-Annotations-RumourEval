This repository contains the annotations for target-independent and target-dependent subsets for the [RumourEval 2019](https://aclanthology.org/S19-2147/) Twitter test set, in which "0" represents "target-independent" and "1" represents "target-dependent". The annotations can be adopted by future studies to evaluate the stance classification models on easy or hard subsets of the RumourEval 2019 test set.

More details can be found in our COLING 2024 paper: [Can We Identify Stance Without Target Arguments? A Study for Rumour Stance Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12665)
